Adamantium Starter-Kit
======================
Adamantium Starter-Kit for WordPress was created to speed up the development of WordPress themes, with flexibility and durability of the Adamantium.


Fewer steps than the Moonwalk:
======================
1) Download Adamantium

2) Customize it for your Proyect

3) Satisfied? Repeat on other projects


Let's be honest:
======================
Working with frameworks can make our lives easy, but sometimes we need something that really suits our project. Adamantium's goal is to have a flexible structure that you can really work as a base to have your own code.

License:
======================
Adamantium is open source and is licensed under the GPL license. Feel free to use the Adamantium Starter-Kit for non-commercial and commercial ventures (For example: Premium WordPress themes, client work, etc.). The creator and developer would really appreciate if a link to the Adamantium Starter-Kit was placed inside the CSS file (but it's not mandatory at all!).

Contribute:
======================
Are you using this? If so, become a contributor to itâ€™s growth and stability. If you have problems using it, definitely let me know. Equally, if you have ideas to make it even better, I want to hear them too.
